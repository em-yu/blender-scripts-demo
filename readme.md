# Blender scripts

Toy examples of using Blender python scripts for various use cases. These are meant to be used as examples to ease learning scripting Blender with Python.

* [Rendering 3D meshes](results_rendering) with data from vertex colors (features: turntable animations, setting custom materials).
* [Simple Blender Add-on](vertex_selector) to import many meshes and perform manual vertex selection (this is intended as a super simple example for add-on creation).
* [Geodesic distance visualizer UI](geodesic_distance_ui) that uses [potpourri3d](https://github.com/nmwsharp/potpourri3d) to compute and visualize geodesic distances on a mesh given user chosen source vertices.

Shout out to [Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hsuehtil/) for releasing [BlenderToolbox](https://github.com/HTDerekLiu/BlenderToolbox) which is a great source of inspiration for Blender scripting (focus on figure rendering).
